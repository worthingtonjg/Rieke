Today we tackled one of Utah County’s classic adventures — the hike to Timpanogos Cave. The trail starts in American Fork Canyon and winds its way up the side of the mountain, paved but steep enough to make us earn every step. Rieke, Molly, Ryan, Jana, and I paced ourselves, stopping often to catch our breath and soak in the incredible views of the canyon unfolding beneath us. The higher we climbed, the more rewarding the scenery became — layers of golden trees, dramatic cliffs, and the early hints of fall in the air.

At the top, the effort paid off. The cave tour was absolutely worth the climb. Carved deep into the mountain, the cave system was full of narrow passageways, glittering formations, and otherworldly chambers. The ranger told us that Timpanogos Cave is geologically unique, and it definitely felt that way — like stepping into a hidden world beneath the cliffs we had just hiked. Rieke was fascinated, and we all left with that tired-but-happy feeling that only comes after a good hike and a little bit of wonder.
