We rang in the New Year at home this year, surrounded by good neighbors, great food, and the kind of joyful chaos that makes parties memorable. Our living room turned into a hub of laughter and music, with games going on at every table and enough snacks to feed a small army. Rieke was right in the middle of it all — laughing, joking, and soaking up every moment of her first American New Year’s Eve.

But when midnight hit, she surprised us all with a “German tradition” none of us had ever heard of: stuffing grapes in your mouth while sitting under the table. With zero hesitation (and no fact-checking), everyone joined in. There we were — grown adults and kids alike — crouched under the dining table, cheeks full of grapes, laughing so hard we could barely chew. Whether or not it’s a real tradition didn’t really matter. Rieke made it one, and it was the perfect, quirky, hilarious way to welcome 2025.
