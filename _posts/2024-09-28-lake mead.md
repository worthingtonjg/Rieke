This weekend we took our annual trip to Lake Mead — a family tradition on Jana’s side that we all look forward to every year. It’s one of those weekends that hits pause on everyday life and replaces it with sunshine, water, and as much fun as you can cram into a few days. We stayed, as always, at the Hoover Dam Lodge, perched up on the hill just outside Henderson. From there, the view of the lake is stunning — especially in the early morning when the water is glassy and the world feels still.

Jana’s family brought their usual fleet of jet skis and ski boats, and we rented our classic patio boat to anchor the day. Once we found a quiet beach to call our own, the rest of the weekend was all about floating, swimming, jet skiing, wakeboarding, and soaking up the sun. Rieke jumped right in — literally and figuratively — and spent hours out on the water with the cousins, trying everything and laughing the whole time. It was the perfect mix of chaos and calm, and a memory we’re pretty sure she’ll never forget.

We are still looking for a photo, but Rieke road a jetski and learned to wakeboard as well!  We also celebrated Rieke's birthday (which was September 27th) with some cake on the beach.  When we get home we will have a real birthday party with some of her friends.
