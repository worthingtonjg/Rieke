Tonight we introduced Rieke to one of our favorite summer experiences — outdoor theater at the Sundance Resort up Provo Canyon. The drive alone was worth it, winding up through dense forest and climbing higher into the mountains until the road opened up into a view that never gets old. For Rieke, who comes from a very flat region of Germany, the towering mountains surrounding us were absolutely awe-inspiring. She kept turning in circles just to take it all in — it reminded us not to take the beauty of Utah for granted.

The show for the night was Newsies, an energetic, all-American musical about bold newspaper boys and big-city grit. We brought lawn chairs and sat in the grass on the slope of the ski hill, with the stage nestled just below us. Trees framed the scene, and the peaks stood tall in the background, like a natural amphitheater. It was one of those evenings where the setting, the story, and the company all came together perfectly — crisp mountain air, good music, and a sense that we were giving Rieke a memory she’d never forget.
