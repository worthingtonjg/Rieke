It took longer than usual this year, but we finally got enough snow to make it feel like a proper Utah winter. On January 4th, the clouds delivered, and by the afternoon the world outside was covered in a soft, white blanket — just right for sledding.

We grabbed the sleds and headed across the street to the park. Molly and Rieke wasted no time racing to the top of the hill, and they spent the entire afternoon flying down the slopes, laughing, wiping out, and dragging their sleds back up for another run. It was one of those classic winter moments — red cheeks, snow-packed boots, and endless energy. Rieke had been hoping for snow all season, and this was the perfect way to enjoy it when it finally came.
