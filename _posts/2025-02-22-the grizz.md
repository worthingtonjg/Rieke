Tonight was another fun AYUSA event, and this one had a little more action than usual — Jen invited all the exchange students and their host families to a Utah Grizzlies hockey game! None of us are exactly hockey experts, but it didn’t matter. The energy in the arena was electric, and Rieke was instantly hooked — especially once the gloves came off and the first fight broke out on the ice. Welcome to hockey, American-style.

After the game, we got to go down onto the ice ourselves. They gave us sticks and pucks and let us take a few shots right there where the pros had been skating just minutes before. Slipping around on the ice, laughing, and pretending we knew what we were doing made for an unforgettable ending to the night. It was fast, loud, and a little chilly — in other words, a perfect hockey experience.
