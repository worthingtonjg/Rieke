March was Missionary Month in our ward — a time when everything from Sunday lessons to youth activities centered around sharing the gospel and helping others come closer to Christ. For Rieke, who isn’t a member of our church but is Christian, it was a meaningful and enjoyable time. She may not have shared every belief, but she fully embraced the spirit of the month.

She looked forward to dressing up each Sunday, always putting care into her outfit and radiating quiet confidence as she walked into church. More than anything, she loved the friendships she’d built and the welcoming atmosphere that made her feel included. She participated in every activity with genuine interest — from service projects to lessons about missionary life — and added her own thoughtful perspective when she could. Watching her engage with such openness was a quiet testament to the kind of heart she has.
