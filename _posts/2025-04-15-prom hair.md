title: "Hair ~ Experimenting before Prom"

Prom season is officially on the horizon, and around here, that means one thing: it’s time to start planning the hair. Forget the dress (for now) — the real magic starts with the right curls, pins, and style. This afternoon, Jana and Rieke spent time in full prom-prep mode, experimenting with different hairstyles and trying out a few looks to see what might work best for the big night.

There were bobby pins everywhere, curling irons heating up, and lots of laughter as they tried to strike the perfect balance between elegant and effortlessly cool. Rieke looked stunning no matter what they tried — but watching her and Jana bond through the process made it even better. It wasn’t just about getting ready for prom — it was about enjoying the lead-up, one twist and braid at a time.
