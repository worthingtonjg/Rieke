Today we took a road trip south to Eagle Point Ski Resort in Beaver, Utah — one of those beautiful hidden-gem destinations perfect for a winter getaway. The drive down was smooth, but of course we had to make the most important stop of the trip: the gas station in Beaver with the giant wooden beaver out front. Naturally, we pulled over for photos — because how can you go to Beaver and not get a picture with a giant beaver?

It was a fun start to what would be a great mountain adventure. Snow, skis, and small-town charm — Utah really knows how to do winter right.
