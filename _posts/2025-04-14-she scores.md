We’re not 100% sure if this was the exact date, but the story is too good not to tell. Rieke, who usually plays defense on her lacrosse team, got a rare chance to switch things up. Her coach had set a goal that every girl on the team would get the opportunity to score at least once during the season — so each game, he rotated someone from defense up to offense for their shot.

It didn’t always work out, but today was Rieke’s turn — and luck was on her side. She took the field with determination, and her teammates backed her up completely, passing her the ball every chance they got and keeping her right in the middle of the action. Then it happened — mid-game, Rieke scored her first goal! The sideline erupted, and you could see the pride on her face from across the field. She proved she’s not just a solid defender — she’s got some serious offensive skills, too.
