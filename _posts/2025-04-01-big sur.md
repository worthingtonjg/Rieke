Today we took one of the most scenic drives in the country — the stretch of coastline through Big Sur. We spent the day winding along Highway 1, hugging cliffs, crossing dramatic bridges, and weaving through quiet redwood forests. The road itself was an adventure, with breathtaking views at nearly every turn. We pulled off at several scenic spots to stretch our legs, snap photos, and soak in the coastal air.

We walked along a few beaches, dipping our toes in the Pacific again and even stopping at one with supposedly “purple” sand. Truth be told, the sand didn’t exactly wow us — just kind of looked like regular sand with a faint tint if you squinted — but the surrounding cliffs and ocean more than made up for it. The whole day felt like driving through a nature documentary. By the time we headed back, we were full of awe, photos, and a little more sand than we bargained for.
