Today we took a mini road trip out to the Little Sahara Sand Dunes — one of Utah’s most surprising and underrated spots. While Utah is technically a desert, it’s a high desert, so coming across massive, rolling sand dunes just a short drive away feels a little surreal. We loaded up the car with sleds, sunscreen, snacks, and Rieke’s bestie Addie, and headed out for a day of adventure.

The dunes were incredible. Towering hills of soft sand stretched out in every direction, and we wasted no time climbing to the top and sledding down — over and over again. Rieke and Addie were covered in sand within minutes and laughing the whole time. We all got a little sunburned, but feeling that warm sand between our toes and seeing the Utah desert in a whole new light made it totally worth it. It was a simple, sandy, unforgettable day.
