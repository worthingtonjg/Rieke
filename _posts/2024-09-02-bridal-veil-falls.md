Labor Day gave us the perfect excuse for another mountain adventure, so we packed up the bikes (and Molly’s trusty scooter) and headed back up Provo Canyon. This time our destination was Bridal Veil Falls — one of the most iconic spots in the canyon and a favorite for locals and visitors alike. We got dropped off at the top of the trail and coasted down the scenic walking and biking path that winds alongside the river.

The ride was peaceful and beautiful, with cool mountain air and glimpses of early autumn starting to show in the trees. When we reached the falls, we parked the bikes and wandered into the shallow water at the base. It was cold, as expected, but refreshing — and it didn’t take long for shoes to come off and for everyone to start posing for pictures under the misty spray. Afterward, we finished the ride down the canyon, feeling grateful once again for how much beauty is tucked into our backyard — and how much more fun it is when shared with Rieke.
