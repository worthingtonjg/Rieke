Today was all about the slopes — well, the bunny slopes to start. We hit Eagle Point Ski Resort with high hopes and a little caution. Rieke had skied before but wasn’t totally confident, so we started small, easing our way into the day. The bunny hill became home base for a while as she shook off the nerves, especially when it came to getting on and off the lift — a rite of passage for every skier, really.

But something clicked as the day went on. Bit by bit, run by run, Rieke gained confidence and speed. She graduated from green circles to blue squares and was soon riding the bigger lifts like a pro. It was awesome to watch her go from hesitant to fearless, all in one day. She couldn’t wait to get home and tell her brother and sister back in Germany all about her skiing triumph — and probably rub it in just a little.
