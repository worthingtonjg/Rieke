After several days of road-tripping, beach-hopping, and sightseeing, today was exactly what we needed — a do-nothing kind of day at the KOA. The weather had been rainy for most of the trip so far, but we finally got a few hours of sunshine, and we took full advantage of it.

Rieke spent the day living her best RV life — lounging in her pajamas, snacking on cookies and potato salad, and soaking up the sun by the pool whenever the clouds cleared. It was her kind of perfect: slow, sunny, and full of snacks. Molly had a similar approach to the day, but she split her time between the bounce pad and the game shack, jumping from activity to activity (and occasionally checking in for snacks, too).

It wasn’t a big adventure day, but it was the kind that helps you recharge — and after all the fun we’d packed in so far, we welcomed the quiet.
