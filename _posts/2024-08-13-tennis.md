One of the first things Rieke wanted to do after settling in was get involved in school life — and she didn’t waste any time. She signed up for the Payson High School tennis team before classes even started, excited to try something new and eager to make friends. She looked great in her tennis outfit and wore it proudly, but after a few long practices in the Utah sun, she started joking (with only a little seriousness) about the farmer’s tan she was earning. Still, the time on the court was worth it.

Joining the team turned out to be a great decision. Not only did it give Rieke a solid start to the school year, but it also helped her find her first close friend — a girl named Rachel. Soon, they were inseparable. When Rieke missed the bus (which, let’s be honest, happened more than a few times), Rachel would swing by to pick her up — usually cutting it close to the bell. Tennis was just the beginning; before long, they were signing up for other school sports and activities together, building a year full of new adventures.
