While I was working, Jana and Molly took Rieke on another mountain adventure — this time up Payson Canyon to a little spot we love called The Grotto. It’s a short hike through the woods that ends at a small, shaded waterfall. Rieke and Molly didn’t hesitate to wade right into the cold mountain water, grinning and giving us a big thumbs-up from the base of the falls. It was a simple moment, but one that perfectly captured the joy of summer — feet in the stream, surrounded by trees, and not a care in the world.

Later that day, Rieke got to step into a more familiar rhythm as she joined Molly for karate class. One of the reasons we chose Rieke as our exchange student was her background in taekwondo — something she shares with Molly. Watching them kick and stretch side by side felt like more than just a fun activity; it was the beginning of a bond built around shared passion and respect. Two girls from opposite sides of the world, connecting through martial arts — pretty cool.
