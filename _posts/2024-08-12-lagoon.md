Today was all about fun — the kind that leaves you sun-kissed, hoarse from laughing (and maybe screaming), and happily exhausted. We drove up past Salt Lake City to Lagoon, Utah’s biggest amusement park, for a full day of rides, roller coasters, and making memories. It’s about a 90-minute drive from Santaquin, but with snacks, music, and a car full of excitement, the trip flew by.

Rieke jumped into the spirit of things right away, tackling every ride we threw at her. From spinning rides to high-speed coasters, she was all in — and so were we. It was the kind of day that reminded us how much fun it is to be a little reckless and a lot silly. We spent the entire day at the park, squeezing in as many rides as we could, and left with sore feet, full hearts, and just enough leftover energy to recap our favorites on the drive home.
