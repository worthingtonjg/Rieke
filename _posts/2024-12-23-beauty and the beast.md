The night before Christmas Eve, we had the chance to experience something truly unforgettable — a performance of Beauty and the Beast at the Hale Center Theater. I’ve seen a lot of live shows over the years, but I’ve never seen anything like this. From the moment the curtain lifted, we were completely swept away.

The stage itself was a marvel — full of moving parts, rising platforms, and dramatic drops that shifted seamlessly during the performance, even with actors standing on them. The sets were stunning, the costumes dazzling, and the cast brought the story to life in a way that felt both intimate and grand. Rieke was completely enchanted, and honestly, so were the rest of us. It was breathtaking from start to finish — a perfect night of magic and storytelling that none of us will forget anytime soon.
