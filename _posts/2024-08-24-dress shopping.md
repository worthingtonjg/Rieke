One of the things Rieke was most excited to experience during her year in America was a classic high school dance — and Homecoming was first on the list. But before she could think about finding a date, she needed to find the dress. Jana happily volunteered for the mission, and the two of them headed out on one of what would become many shopping adventures. Turns out, Rieke loves to shop — and she and Jana made quite the team.

After trying on half the store (and maybe a few pairs of shoes that had nothing to do with Homecoming), Rieke found a cute dress that felt just right — along with shoes to match, of course. She came home beaming, already planning her hair and wondering which boy might ask her to the dance. But even if no one had, it wouldn’t have mattered — she was going to that dance, looking fabulous, and soaking up the full high school experience.
