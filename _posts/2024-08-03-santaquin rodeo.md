Less than 24 hours after arriving in Utah, Rieke got a crash course in American culture — cowboy-style. We took her to the Santaquin Rodeo, which, surprisingly, was a first for all of us. Despite having lived in Utah for years, we’d somehow never made it to a rodeo. But with Rieke here, it felt like the perfect excuse to finally dive in and experience something authentically Western.

The arena was full of energy — cowboys wrangling horses, bull riders defying gravity (and common sense), and a whole lot of dust swirling in the air. We found a spot on the ground and spread out a blanket, settling in for the show. It was windy and overcast, which turned out to be perfect weather for sitting outside. The rodeo was loud, gritty, and way more fun than any of us expected. Watching it through Rieke’s eyes made it all the more memorable — a little bit of culture shock, a lot of excitement, and a great way to kick off her adventure in America.
