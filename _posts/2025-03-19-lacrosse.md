Rieke is never one to shy away from trying something new. When girls wrestling was offered at school, she gave it a go — but quickly realized it wasn’t her thing. No problem. With her usual energy and optimism, she pivoted right into the next season: lacrosse.

Several of the girls from the tennis team were also joining, so it felt like a natural next step. She picked up a stick, bought some super fashionable goggles (because of course she did), and hit the field like she’d been playing for years. Rieke ended up playing defense — and she was good. Her height and long reach gave her an edge, and she wasn’t afraid to get in the mix and use her stick to block and intercept. It didn’t take long for everyone to see: she was a born lacrosse player.
